# Algorithm Lab - Educational Algorithms Laboratory

I compiled in a repository the implementations of fundamental algorithms written on Java, organized by design paradigms to help others to learn algorithmic problem-solving and understand complexity analysis.

## Modules Overview

### Module 1: Basic Sorting
Algorithms that reorder elements by applying comparisons and swaps. Ideal for understanding how basic algorithms work and learning about complexity.

**Algorithms:**
- Selection Sort - O(n²) - always
- Insertion Sort - O(n²) average, O(n) best case
- Bubble Sort - O(n²) - always
- Optimized Bubble Sort - O(n) best case with flag

**Use Case:** Foundation for understanding algorithm fundamentals and complexity analysis.

### Module 2: Divide and Conquer
Divides problems into smaller subproblems, solves them recursively, and combines results. Great for mastering recursive problem-solving.

**Algorithms:**
- Binary Search - O(log n)
- Quick Sort - O(n log n) average
- Maximum Subarray - O(n log n)
- Quick Select - O(n) average
- 10+ additional problems

**Use Case:** For problems that can be decomposed recursively.

### Module 3: Backtracking
Explores all possible combinations recursively, pruning useless branches to optimize search.

## Tech Stack
