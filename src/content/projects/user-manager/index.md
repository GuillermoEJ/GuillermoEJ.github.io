# User Manager - MERN Stack Application

A comprehensive full-stack web application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that demonstrates complete CRUD operations with a modern, component-based architecture.

This is a production-ready PoC showcasing full-stack JavaScript development with separation of concerns between client and server.

## Features

- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete user data seamlessly
- **RESTful API**: Structured backend with Express.js managing modular HTTP routes
- **Dynamic UI**: Fully responsive state management leveraging React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular front-end logic separating concerns (Modals, Lists, Forms)
- **Client-Side Routing**: Fast, single-page application navigation using React Router
- **Data Modeling**: Robust database schemas enforced by Mongoose ODM
- **Modern Styling**: Responsive UI with React-Bootstrap

## Tech Stack
