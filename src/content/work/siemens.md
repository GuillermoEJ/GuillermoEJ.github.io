As a Software Engineer Intern at Siemens Mobility, I work within an international engineering team to support the Rail9000 portfolio. Operating under Scrum workflows, I develop software components using the Gradle ecosystem and ensure high standards of reliability by maintaining the product's code quality profiles. This role allows me to apply agile methodologies to large-scale systems while collaborating across borders.
