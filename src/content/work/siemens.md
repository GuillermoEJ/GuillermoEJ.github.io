As an intern at [Siemens Mobility](https://www.mobility.siemens.com) headquarters in Madrid, I develop Java/Groovy components for the Rail9000 portfolio within an international Scrum environment. I've focused on improving system stability and processing efficiency through strategic refactoring of legacy code, achieving a Triple A SonarQube rating and successfully reducing technical debt while enhancing product reliability and security. Additionally, I've optimized CI/CD pipelines by integrating server-side tools and automated tests, resulting in faster deployment cycles and higher overall code quality.

**Key technologies:** Java · Groovy · Gradle · Jira · GitHub · SonarQube
