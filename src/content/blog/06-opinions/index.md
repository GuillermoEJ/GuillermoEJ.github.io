To move beyond simple sentences, you need to link clauses using the particle **と**.

### Grammatical Structure
Before adding **と思う** (I think) or **と言いました** (Said), the preceding verb must be in its **Plain Form** (Dictionary, Nai, or Ta form).

* **Example:** 明日、雨が降る**と**思います (I think it will rain tomorrow).

### Nuance: と vs. を
Unlike the object particle を, **と** acts as a quote marker. It wraps the entire preceding thought or sentence into a single unit that the verb then acts upon.
