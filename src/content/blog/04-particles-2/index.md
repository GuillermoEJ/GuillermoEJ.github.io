At the N4 level, the ambiguity between particles starts to fade as we learn specific rules for location and direction.

### に (Ni) vs. で (De)
The biggest hurdle is distinguishing between location of *existence* and location of *action*:
* **に:** Used with verbs like *imasu* or *arimasu* (existence) or for a specific point in time.
* **で:** Used when an action takes place (e.g., *shokudou de tabemasu*).

### へ (He) vs. に (Ni)
While often interchangeable for "to," **へ** emphasizes the direction or the journey toward a goal, whereas **に** emphasizes the arrival or the destination itself.
