N4 introduces several ways to say "if." Each has a slightly different logic.

### ～たら (Tara)
This is the most versatile conditional. It is based on the **past tense + ra**. It focuses on what happens *after* a condition is met.
* Example: 時間があっ**たら**、行きます (If I have time, I will go).

### ～ば (Ba)
This is a more formal or "pure" conditional. It emphasizes the relationship between the condition and the result. To conjugate, change the final *u* to an *e* sound and add *ba* (e.g., *tabereba*).
