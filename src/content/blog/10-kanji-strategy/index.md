By the N4 level, memorizing characters by rote becomes inefficient. The key is to study **Radicals (部首)**.

### The Anatomy of a Kanji
Most N4 Kanji are composed of a semantic part (meaning) and a phonetic part (reading). Identifying the "building blocks" helps in guessing the meaning of new characters before checking a dictionary.

### My Current Kanji Inventory (N5 - N4 Sample)
As a student at the N4 level, I have mastered approximately 300 characters. Here is how I categorize them to make them easier to recall:

| Category | Kanji Examples | Logic / Radical |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature & Elements** | 日, 月, 火, 水, 木, 金, 土 | Basic N5 elements and days of the week. |
| **Direction & Space** | 上, 下, 左, 右, 中, 外, 北, 南 | Spatial orientation and cardinal points. |
| **Human & Body** | 人, 子, 女, 男, 目, 口, 手, 足 | Human-related radicals. |
| **Movement & Actions** | 行, 来, 食, 飲, 見, 聞, 書, 読 | Common N4 verbs in their base form. |
| **Time & Measurement** | 時, 分, 午, 前, 後, 今, 週, 年 | Essential for scheduling and history. |
| **Adjectives & State** | 高, 安, 大, 小, 長, 多, 少, 新 | Core descriptors for objects and places. |

### The N4 Goal
My current strategy is focusing on the remaining characters needed for the JLPT N4. I prioritize learning them in context with vocabulary rather than in isolation. For example, instead of just learning **新** (new), I learn it as part of **新聞** (newspaper - *shinbun*), which also reinforces the Kanji for "hear/listen".



I recommend using a spaced repetition system (SRS) like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to keep these 300+ characters in your long-term memory while you bridge the gap to N3.
