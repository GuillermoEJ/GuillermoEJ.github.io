Japanese does not have relative pronouns like "who," "which," or "that." Instead, we place a verb in the plain form directly before a noun.

### How it works
Think of the entire phrase as a giant adjective.
* **Standard:** ケーキを食べました (I ate the cake).
* **Relative Clause:** [私が食べた]ケーキ ([The cake that I ate]).

### Key Rule
The subject inside the modifying clause often takes the particle **が** instead of **は**.
* Example: [父**が**作った]料理は美味しいです (The food [my father made] is delicious).
