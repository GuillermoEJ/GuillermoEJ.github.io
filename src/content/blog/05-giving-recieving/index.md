Japanese uses different verbs for "giving" depending on who is giving to whom. This reflects the cultural concept of *Uchi-Soto* (Inside-Outside).

### The Three Main Verbs
1. **あげる (Ageru):** I give to you / someone gives to someone else.
2. **くれる (Kureru):** Someone gives to me (the most important one to master!).
3. **もらう (Morau):** To receive from someone.

### The ~Te Form Extension
When you add the ~te form, these verbs describe *favors*:
* **～てあげる:** To do a favor for someone.
* **～てくれる:** Someone does a favor for me (implies gratitude).
