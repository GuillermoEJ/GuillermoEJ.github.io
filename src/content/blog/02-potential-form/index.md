In N5, we learn *koto ga dekiru*. In N4, we streamline this by changing the verb itself into the **Potential Form (可能形)**.

### How to Conjugate
For Group I verbs, we shift the final vowel from the **u-column** to the **e-column** and add *ru*:
* *Yomu* (Read) → *Yomeru* (Can read)
* *Iku* (Go) → *Ikeru* (Can go)

### Key Particle Change
The most important thing to remember is the particle shift. Often, the object particle **を (wo)** changes to **が (ga)** when using the potential form:
* 日本語**を**話します (I speak Japanese)
* 日本語**が**話せます (I can speak Japanese)
