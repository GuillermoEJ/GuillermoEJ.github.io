At the end of the N4 level, we encounter the **Passive (受身)** and **Causative (使役)** forms.

### Passive Form (～られる)
Used when something is done to you. In Group I, change the *u* to the *a* column and add *reru*.
* *Kaku* (Write) → *Kakareru* (To be written).

### Causative Form (～させる)
Used to express "making" or "letting" someone do something.
* *Taberu* → *Tabesaseru* (To make/let someone eat).
