Japanese distinguishes heavily between **Transitive (他動詞)** and **Intransitive (自動詞)** verbs. This is a common pain point for N4 students because the verbs often look very similar.

### The Fundamental Difference
* **Transitive:** Requires a direct object and an agent. (Uses particle **を**).
    * *Mado wo akemasu* (I open the window).
* **Intransitive:** Describes a state or an action happening without a specified agent. (Uses particle **が**).
    * *Mado ga akimasu* (The window opens).

### Study Strategy
I recommend learning these in pairs. If you see *shimeru* (to close something), immediately look for *shimaru* (to be closed). It helps to visualize the "force" being applied in transitive verbs versus the "state" of intransitive ones.
