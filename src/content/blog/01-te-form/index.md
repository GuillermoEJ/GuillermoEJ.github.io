The **Te-form** is arguably the most important conjugation in the N4 syllabus. It doesn't have a specific tense by itself; instead, it acts as a "hook" to connect thoughts, ask for favors, or describe ongoing actions.

### The Conjugation Logic

I categorize these by verb groups to keep the logic consistent:

* **Group I (U-Verbs):** The ending changes based on the last syllable (e.g., *u, tsu, ru* → *tte*).
* **Group II (Ru-Verbs):** Simply drop the *ru* and add *te* (e.g., *taberu* → *tabete*).
* **Group III (Irregular):** *Suru* becomes *shite* and *Kuru* becomes *kite*.

### Common Use Cases
1. **Requests:** ～てください (Please do...)
2. **Present Progressive:** ～ています (Am doing...)
3. **Sequencing:** Linking multiple verbs in one sentence to show a chronological order of events.
